# Credit Risk Analysis Report

## Analysis Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to use machine learning to determine how well we can predict if a person is healthy (low-risk) or unhealthy (high-risk) if they were to be given a loan. Essentially, we're predicting the creditworthiness of a potential borrower. The dataset used is of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company. The variables I was trying to predict with these models were were how many loans were predicted to be low-risk and high-risk, vs how many are actually low-risk and high-risk. This data was displayed using a confusion matrix. I also wanted to predict how well we can determine if a person is low or high risk when being given a loan, using accuracy scores and recall.

The balanced accuracy score of the first model is approximately 95%. However, this model is better at predicting low-risk loans than it is high-risk. As the recall for healthy loans is 0.99, whereas the recall for unhealthy loans is 0.91. In the confusion matrix we see there were 56 false positives, and 102 false negatives.

The balanced accuracy score of this second model is approximately 99%. This is also true for the recall, which is 0.99 for both low and high-risk loans. This model predicts high-risk loans much better than the first. In the confusion matrix we see there were 4 false positives, and 116 false negatives.

## Summary

Based on the accuracy score and recall, the second model is a best fit for predicting both high-risk and low-risk loans. While the confusion matrix predicts slightly more false negatives, it predicts a considerable amount less of false positives. Therefore, I would recommend using Model 2, the logistic regression model fitted with oversampled data.
